* Supported OS

GNU/Linux

* Requirements: 

For driver: libusb-dev, libudev-dev, libpq-dev

For web interface: apache2 with apache2-mod-php5 (or other web browser with php support), postgresql

For database handling postgresql server is also required. psql client is recommended for debugging purposes.

* How to compile

firstly create bin directory in the project tree: mkdir bin
then run ``make'' in command line: make

* Installing web page

Run postgresql as user postgres and add user as role. Create database and allow user to do anything with the database. Basically you need to do (change <username> with your username):
Run psql and within the psql shell type in:
	create table <username>;
	grant all privileges on database <username> to <username>;

I would also recommend:
	grant all privileges on database <username> to root;

Finish with
	\q

As normal user type in bash shell: psql
	\i sql-tables/polar-createtable

Copy directory web where it can be found by web browser. Edit config.php and enter your username and password required to access database.
